# craigslist.py: A Python API for searching Craigslist

This is a WIP project to make Craigslist searchable via a Python API. The API
works by scraping Craigslist directly, which I've been told can get your IP
banned at high volumes.

Status:
    - Decent job of parsing job, housing and for-sale posts
    - Relies on raw location (domain name) and category ("hhh", "sss", etc.) data

TODO:
    - Tests
    - Wrap locations and search categories in constants
